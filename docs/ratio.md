Grid rows and columns are not limited to same width columns and same height rows.
By defining a `ratio` for a row or a column, the layout of the grid will change accordingly.
```swift
let grid = UIView.gridLayoutView(items: [GridItem(rectangle1, row: 0, column: 0),
                                         GridItem(rectangle2, row: 0, column: 1)],
                                 rows: [.auto],
                                 columns: [.fillWidth(ratio: 1), .fillWidth(ratio: 2)])
```
This example defines two columns: the first with a ratio of 1 and the second with a ratio of 2. This means the horizontal space will be split in 3 units, with the first column taking 1 unit and the second column taking 2 units.

```swift
let rectangle1 = buildRectangle(color: .blue)
let rectangle2 = buildRectangle(color: .red)

let grid = UIView.gridLayoutView(items: [GridItem(rectangle1, row: 0, column: 0),
                                         GridItem(rectangle2, row: 1, column: 0)],
                                 rows: [.fillWidth(ratio: 1), .fillWidth(ratio: 3)],
                                 columns: [.auto])
```
This example defines two rows: the first with a ratio of 1 and the second with a ratio of 3. This means the vertical space will be split in 4 units, with the first row taking 1 unit and the second row taking 3 units.
